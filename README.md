# Examples for the `Toggle` in SwiftUI

This is the companion repository for both the [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/Dx2s6GUJ2K8) as well as the [blog post](https://stefanblos.com/posts/toggle_in_swiftui/) I made on the topic of the `Toggle` view in SwiftUI.

You should definitely check those posts out to see explanations for everything that can be found in this repository.

The following examples can be found:

* A [BasicToggleView](/Shared/BasicToggleView.swift) which shows (surprise) the basics of creating a Toggle
* A [ResponsiveToggleView](/Shared/ResponsiveToggleView.swift) showing you how to use one view to show different styles on iOS and macOS respectively
* A [ToggleWithCustomStyle](/Shared/ToggleWithCustomStyle.swift) which uses the [DarkModeStyle](/Shared/DarkModeStyle.swift) to give you an example on using a custom style that is created in the tutorial.

If there is anything you would like to add, let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stefanjblos) or feel free to create a PR. :)
